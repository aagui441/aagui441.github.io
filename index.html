    <p> I am a junior at Bob Jones University studying a double major of Business Andministration, Finance and Communication. I also work with the DFH departments and with Student Recruitment.</p>
    <p>
      I am originally from Patagonia, Argentina and I came to study in the US in 2020. It has been an amazing experience where I got to meet new peuple, build relationships, and strengthen my relationship with God.
