         <p>I am a junior with a double major in Business Administration and Communication. I am from Patagonia, Argentina and I came to study to the US.</p>
         <p>
            I am enjoying the experience of living in the US because it allows me to meet new people and create great relationships. It also gives me an opportunity to explore new places and have fun with my friends.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I really enjoy goign on road trips, being in nature, and relaxing while listening to music.
